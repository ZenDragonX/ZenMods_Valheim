# VANILLA - QoL

This is a subset of [CORE](https://thunderstore.io/c/valheim/p/ZenDragon/ZenModpack_CORE/).  It is tailored for players who want to connect to **vanilla servers.**  It does not offer the full capabilities of the entire [CORE](https://thunderstore.io/c/valheim/p/ZenDragon/ZenModpack_CORE/) experience, however it provides huge QoL improvements out of the box and will work with any vanilla server.

NOTE: By default this is configured with `ZenCompass` which replaces your Minimap in the corner of the screen.  Ideal for NoMap immersive games.  If you want to use a map and do not want the compass you can disable the `ZenCompass` module.

Like all ZenMods this Modpack originated from my desire for a custom high performance Valheim experience. I wanted to avoid all the conflicts of bundling a bunch of mods together that may not work correctly with each other, or have overlapping functionality because they were all written by different authors with different ideas and UI paradigms.

Therefor all ZenMods were written and designed to work together seamlessly.  When combined, these mods operate as a single symbiotic whole. Yet, due to their modular nature, each one can function individually as well.

Best with these Valheim world modifiers enabled:
- NoMap - Getting lost is fun!

## Small Sample...

- `ZenRedecorate`: Move chests and other furniture around without destroying them.
- `ZenSign`: Assign an item to a sign to see the amount available in nearby containers.
- `ZenUseItem`: Assign items directly from your inventory without using 1-8 hotkey.
- `ZenHoverItem`: Show icons for items such as container contents without opening them plus many more things.
- `ZenItemStand`: Open Armor Stands and Item Stands like containers.
- `ZenBeehive`: Open Beehives like containers.
- `ZenRecycle`: Obliterators return a randomly selected ingredient of the item, or smash trash on the ground anywhere.
- `ZenBreeding`: Prevent cpu overload by blocking exponential population growth of tames by sterilizing offspring.
- And much more...
