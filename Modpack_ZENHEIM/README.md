# ZENHEIM: Enhanced Valheim

The rules have changed.  A new experience unlike anything you have seen before.  Turn off your map via Valheim's World Modifiers and let the Cartography Table and Compass be your guide! Think wisely, getting lost is part of the adventure!  

Built from the ground up with a [CORE](https://thunderstore.io/c/valheim/p/ZenDragon/ZenModpack_CORE/) set of custom crafted ZenMods to ensure compatibility, reliability, and performance.

Full gamepad support. Pre-configured, ready to play! 

Best with these Valheim World Modifiers enabled:
- NoMap - Getting lost is fun!
- PlayerEvents aka Player Based Events / Raids
- Fire (optional, if you want hard mode!)

## New Game Rules

- Keep your fires lit!  Workbenches no longer protect against monster spawns, torches and fireplaces do.
- Each player sees their own version of the Boss Stones depending on their own progression so you don't all have to play at the same time.
- No wooden arrows, they are over-powered.
- Low-map, use the Cartography Table and Compass to find your way. The map visibility depends on the age of the table, not you. 
- Map Pins must be crafted and applied to signs in the wild, you can not apply them from the table.
- Ships and carts are automatically tracked.
- Death penalty: Keep 1 randomly equipped item. No skill loss (if you disable it on the server). Keep all the food in your belly.
- Regenerate your stamina when standing still even when encumbered or swimming.
- You can sleep in any bed even if you don't own it.
- Better comfort levels improve your healing rate.
- Tamed creatures don't overpopulate because offspring can't reproduce.
- Running on paths consumes half stamina. Paved paths consume no stamina.
- Terrain deformation is limited. No moats or indestructible walls. Build strong defenses accordingly.
- No building on trees. That's cheating, monsters can't hit you there.
- Meadows are safe from raids so newbies don't get wrecked.
- Turrets can have 3 targets instead of 1.
- Shield generators protect your fireplaces from the rain and snow.  
- You can also eject the fuel and shut the shield down manually.
- Keys can only be used once for increased challenge.
- Candles can be refilled.

- Find fuel easily, just tap a fireplace and nearby containers with wood highlight if you don't have it in your inventory.
- Item Stands, Armor Stands, and Beehives all behave like containers for quick easy access.
- Swap your gear at an Armor Stand with one click.
- No need to fumble with 1-8 hotkeys, just select items directly from your inventory to assign to objects.
- Dedicated quick select repair button when hammer is equipped.

## Work Together

By design there are no crafting from containers or other forms of automation because they accelerate the gameplay loop. Instead, you have a robust set of new features for hoard management via signs and redecoration that fix a lot of the painful issues of finding what you are looking for.  Just point at a sign and assign items to it to view the quantity nearby.  Tap a sign to locate the item in a container.  Middle-click an item in your inventory to find it in nearby containers.
