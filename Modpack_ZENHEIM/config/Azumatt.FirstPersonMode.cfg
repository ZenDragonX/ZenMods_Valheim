## Plugin GUID: Azumatt.FirstPersonMode

[1 - General]

## If on, the configuration is locked and can be changed by server admins only. All Synced With Server configurations will be enforced to the clients. [Synced with Server]
# Setting type: Toggle
# Default value: On
# Acceptable values: Off, On
Lock Configuration = On

[1 - Toggles]

## If on, First Person is enabled. [Synced with Server]
# Setting type: Toggle
# Default value: On
# Acceptable values: Off, On
Enable First Person = On

## If on, First Person is enforced to always be on. Respects the Enable First Person configuration and both must be on for First Person to be enforced. [Synced with Server]
# Setting type: Toggle
# Default value: Off
# Acceptable values: Off, On
Enforce First Person = Off

## If on, the camera will not use the culling mode and will instead shrink the head to hide it. This method is a bit better overall as your armor isn't see through, but looks a little weird. Headless people always do. [Not Synced with Server]
# Setting type: Toggle
# Default value: Off
# Acceptable values: Off, On
Hide Head = Off

## If on, the camera will center behind the player when not in First Person. This is useful for people who want to play in third person but want the camera to be centered behind the player and not a little offset like vanilla has it. [Not Synced with Server]
# Setting type: Toggle
# Default value: Off
# Acceptable values: Off, On
Center Behind Player = Off
