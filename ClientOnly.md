## Client Only

This mod operates entirely client side. That means you can connect to any vanilla server with this mod installed.  Other players do not need to have the mod installed.

NOTE:  If you host a game session with this mod installed then it will be considered to be installed on the server since your session is the server. Therefor, all clients will be required to have it.  If you don't want to require all players to have this mod then you will need to host your game in a dedicated server.  You can easily download and run the Valheim Dedicated Server from Steam or host one in the cloud.
