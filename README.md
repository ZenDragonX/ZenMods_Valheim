# ZenDragon Valheim Mods

These mods are designed to enhance the Valheim experience with additional QoL and improvements to the core game experience WITHOUT altering the balance or diverging from the vanilla gameplay.  They polish already exitsting ideas within the Valheim game itself while adding additional ease of use features such as:
- Signs that can show the container contents
- Improved crafting UI
- Moving chests around without smashing them.
- A low-map mode for improved immersion.
- An integrated compass that tracks wind and sun position.
- Control over the raid spawning system
- Target lock so the camera focuses on the target.
- Balances to the combat system
- Mounts that can attack
- Equip items in the water
- Helpful construction system improvements
- Crafting stations can craft from the nearest container - it's linked
- Per-player boss progress and boss stones.
- Enhanced tooltips that are cleaner.
- No stamina use on paved roads and half use on dirt roads
- Recycle your items in the Obliterator.
- Improved cart handling and distribute contents of your cart automatically to nearby chests.
- Limit terrain deformation for enhanced challenge.
- Use items directly from your inventory without needing to put them on the 1-8 hotbar first.
