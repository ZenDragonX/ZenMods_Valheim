# CORE

This Modpack originated from my desire for a custom high performance Valheim experience. I wanted to avoid all the conflicts of bundling a bunch of mods together that may or may not work correctly with each other or have overlapping functionality because they were all written by different authors with different ideas and UI paradigms.

Therefor all ZenMods were written and designed to work together seamlessly.  When combined, these mods operate as a single symbiotic whole. Yet, due to their modular nature, each one can function individually as well.

Best with these Valheim world modifiers enabled:
- NoMap - Getting lost is fun!
- PlayerEvents aka Player Based Events / Raids

## Small Sample...

- `ZenRedecorate`: Move chests and other furniture around without destroying them.
- `ZenSign`: Assign an item to a sign to see the amount available in nearby containers.
- `ZenUseItem`: Assign items directly from your inventory without using 1-8 hotkey.
- `ZenHoverItem`: Show icons for items such as container contents without opening them plus many more things.
- `ZenItemStand`: Open Armor Stands and Item Stands like containers.
- `ZenBeehive`: Open Beehives like containers.
- `ZenRecycle`: Obliterators return a randomly selected ingredient of the item, or smash trash on the ground anywhere.
- `ZenBreeding`: Prevent cpu overload by blocking exponential population growth of tames by sterilizing offspring.
- And much more...
