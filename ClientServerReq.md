## Client / Server Requirements

NOTE: Technically it is *not required* on the server. However, if it is installed on the server then it will force all clients to have it installed as well. This is to enable two modes of usage:
1. Dedicated server admins can put the mod on the server to enforce all clients to have the mod installed and sync admin configs.
2. Trusted friends can agree to run the same mods and connect through a vanilla dedicated server with no enforcement but with locked admin configs.
