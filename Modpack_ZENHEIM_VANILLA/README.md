This pack is designed for players who want incredible QoL improvements while still being able to connect to vanilla servers.

Full gamepad support. Pre-configured, ready to play!

## Work Together

By design there are no crafting from containers or other forms of automation because they accelerate the gameplay loop. Instead, you have a robust set of new features for hoard management via signs that fix a lot of the painful issues of finding what you are looking for.  Just point at a sign and assign items to it to view the quantity nearby.  Tap a sign to locate the item in a container.  Middle-click an item in your inventory to find it in nearby containers.
