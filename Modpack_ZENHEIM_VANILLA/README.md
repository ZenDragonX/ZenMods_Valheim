# ZENHEIM: Enhanced Valheim for Vanilla Servers QoL

### NOTICE 
This is a subset of the [ZENHEIM](https://thunderstore.io/c/valheim/p/ZenDragon/ZENHEIM/) experience.  This pack is designed for players who want incredible QoL improvements while still being able to connect to vanilla servers.  However, if you are playing offline or have a modded server then check out the full potential of [ZENHEIM](https://thunderstore.io/c/valheim/p/ZenDragon/ZENHEIM/)!

The rules have changed.  A new experience unlike anything you have seen before.  Turn off your map via Valheim's World Modifiers and let the Compass be your guide! Think wisely, getting lost is part of the adventure!  

Built from the ground up with a [CORE Vanilla](https://thunderstore.io/c/valheim/p/ZenDragon/ZenModpack_VANILLA/) set of custom crafted ZenMods to ensure compatibility, reliability, and performance.

Full gamepad support. Pre-configured, ready to play! 

Best with these Valheim World Modifiers enabled:
- NoMap - Getting lost is fun!
- Fire (optional, if you want hard mode!)

## Work Together

By design there are no crafting from containers or other forms of automation because they accelerate the gameplay loop. Instead, you have a robust set of new features for hoard management via signs that fix a lot of the painful issues of finding what you are looking for.  Just point at a sign and assign items to it to view the quantity nearby.  Tap a sign to locate the item in a container.  Middle-click an item in your inventory to find it in nearby containers.
